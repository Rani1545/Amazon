I developed an Amazon clone using HTML and CSS, focusing on replicating the layout and design of the e-commerce platform. The project includes a structured homepage with a navigation bar, product sections, and a footer similar to the original site. I utilized CSS for styling, ensuring responsiveness and an appealing user interface. Through this project, I enhanced my front-end development skills, improved my understanding of website structuring, and gained hands-on experience in building visually engaging web pages.
